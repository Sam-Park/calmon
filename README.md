There are four categories these activities will fall into “All”, “Information”, “Games” and “Video”. Each category will only apply to some of the activities, except for the “All” category, which includes the entire list of activities shown.


Your challenge is to build a simple web UI that allows users to filter the list of activities. The UI should have four buttons, when a button is clicked, the list will show only the activities relevant to the currently selected category. A selected category should have its background shaded with a different color to show that it is selected currently. Only one category is allowed to be selected at any given time. The list of activities only needs to be in plain text and the user will not interact with the list itself.
